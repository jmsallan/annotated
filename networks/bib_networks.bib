The model for the gas network is the generalized betweenness centrality model defined in Carvalho et al. (2009). Network interdependence is modeled through a specific interdependence function. Nodes that lead to interdependence are detected using spatial proximity criteria. Authors define three categories of network disturbance: random failures, deliberate attacks and natural disasters. Deliberate attacks are defined as suppression of edges of high load and nodes of high degree. The results of the vulnerability metrics are global vulnerability analysis and critical component analysis. Global vulnerability is measured with network efficiency and damaging rate. Critical component analysis reports the network components whose damage would lead to larger vulnerability.}",

Our approach, based on percolation theory, leads to a general condition for the critical fraction of nodes, p(c), that needs to be removed before the network disintegrates.

The goal of this work is to determine network design guidelines which maximize the robustness of networks to both random failure and intentional attack while keeping the cost of the network (which we take to be the average number of links per node) constant. We find optimal parameters for: (i) scale free networks having degree distributions with a single power-law regime, (ii) networks having degree distributions with two power-law regimes, and (iii) networks described by degree distributions containing two peaks. Of these various kinds of distributions we find that the optimal network design is one in which all but one of the nodes have the same degree, {\$}k{\_}1{\$} (close to the average number of links per node), and one node is of very large degree, {\$}k{\_}2 \backslashsim N{\^{}}{\{}2/3{\}}{\$}, where {\$}N{\$} is the number of nodes in the network.},

@article{Albert2000,
abstract = {Many complex systems display a surprising degree of tolerance against errors. For example, relatively simple organisms grow, persist and reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or environmental interventions, an error tolerance attributed to the robustness of the underlying metabolic network. Complex communication networks display a surprising degree of robustness: although key components regularly malfunction, local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. The stability of these and other complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. Here we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems: it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free networks, which include the World-Wide Web, the Internet, social networks and cells. We find that such networks display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected even by unrealistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks (that is, to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play a vital role in maintaining the network's connectivity). Such error tolerance and attack vulnerability are generic properties of communication networks.},

abstract = {Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators, Josephson junction arrays, excitable media, neural networks, spatial games, genetic control networks and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

Although most theories concerning the origin of these topologies use growing graphs, here we show that a simple optimization process can also account for the observed regularities displayed by most complex nets. Using an evolutionary algorithm involving minimization of link density and average distance, four major types of networks are encountered: (a) sparse exponential-like networks, (b) sparse scale-free networks, (c) star networks and (d) highly dense networks, apparently defining three major phases.
