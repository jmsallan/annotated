abstract = {China's air transportation has experienced rapid growth and major reforms in the past three decades, some of which have been partially successful and are still ongoing today. The paper aims to analyze China's air deregulation experience over the last two decades and its impact on airline competition from a geographical perspective. After the establishment of the "Big Three" in 2002, the paper reveals that there has been a trade-off between the extent of deregulation and airline competition in China because the central government has tended to strengthen the "Big Three" rather than totally open the market to private and locally owned airlines. The paper uses each airline group as the basic unit of analysis and reveals that (1) the air market has been more concentrated in the "Big Three" as a result of the process of air deregulation; (2) airline competition in over two thirds of the airports and one half of the routes has increased in the last 18. years, but the core airports and trunk routes are chiefly dominated by the "Big Three". The peripheral airports and thin routes have been operated by private and locally owned airlines; and (3) regionally, airline competition has occurred in most airports of the eastern region, and it is more intense than in the central and western regions. But even here, competition in the eastern region has however decreased in 1994-2012. The three main contributions of the paper are: (1) the use of two measures of competition in the airline market; (2) the analysis of the historical evolution of competition; and (3) an understanding the role of the geography of competition in the Chinese airline market.},

@article{Fageda2015,
abstract = {In a context of limited organic growth, some low-cost airlines have considered business strategies that are changing two key principles of the low-cost airline business model: fare unbundling and point-to-point operations. Using a multivariate analysis we identify the influence of several route characteristics on the share that European pure low-cost and hybrid low-cost carriers have on the routes they operate. Results show that, from a network perspective, the distance between the archetypical low-cost carrier business model and the adapted low-cost carrier business model with a hybrid approach is widening. Differences are also clear between hybrids offering connecting services and hybrids offering fare bundling. The results are also important from an airport policy perspective, since secondary airports and legacy airports in transition could be able to reduce the gap between them and the main hub airports.},

Archetypal LCCs have a large share in long routes with low density, with high proportion of leisure travellers, and tend to operate routes in a monopolistic regime. Hybrid LCCs tend to have higher shares in routes with airports close to the city centre, and in routes that have a hub airport as an endpoint. LCCs that offer transfer services and fare bundling may be offering indirect service in city pairs with long distance or pairs not having yet a direct connection. The aim of offering fare bundling may be targeting business passengers, thus competing with full-service carriers. The emergence of hybrid LCC business models can be an opportunity for some airports, that may act as hubs of connecting services offered by LCCs.}",

The traditional business model of low cost carriers (LCC) is trying to widen their catchment areas and increase their market shares by offering flights at lower fares. As airlines primarily compete on their base ticket fares, LLCs unbundle the traditional all-inclusive product, offering many services as ancillaries. In addition to these services, LCCs offer also commision-based products (hotel rooms, car rentals, etc.) or sell frequent-flyer points to program partners (e.g., car rental companies). The parameters to evaluate the effectiveness of this business model are average weekly frequency and average distance of routes. With data up to 2010, authors detect that this model is going to their limits, as average frequencies decrease and average distance increases. They predict that LCCs’ strategic actions will include shifts fo primary airports, enhance random connect systems (self-hubbing), entering airline alliances or acquiring other companies.}",

@article{Burghouwt2015,
abstract = {Using a 24-year analysis period (1990-2013), a new perspective is offered on long-term first- and second-order developments following liberalisation of the intra-EU air transport market. The focus of the analysis is on supply-side issues, such as airline output, structure of supply, yields, business models, and the position of (former) flag carriers.We find that air transport liberalisation in the EU internal market has facilitated significant growth in both the number and frequency of routes. Greater competition and lower fares at the route level went hand in hand with ongoing consolidation. The first and second liberalisation packages have enabled former flag carriers to develop into full-service hub-and-spoke carriers. It was only after the third package (1993-1997) that low-cost carriers were able to fully develop Europe-wide, point-to-point networks. They rapidly achieved a substantial market share after 2000. Following the adoption of the third package of liberalisation measures, charter operators launched scheduled operations as leisure airlines and adopted in part the new low-cost business model.Until 2013, direct competition between low-cost carriers and former flag carriers was limited due to different route development strategies. This picture has changed in recent years since more low-cost carriers have begun to focus on primary hubs. The competitive impact of the rapidly expanding new generation of hub carriers from Turkey and the Gulf has further increased competitive pressure on the former European flag carriers. Consequently, consolidation of the European airline industry is likely to continue, as well as the ongoing effort to reduce costs. Finally, rising competitive pressure may incentivise EU member states to develop a more protective national aviation policy.},

They identify three distinct developmental phases. In the first phase (1990-1993) supply-side reactions remained very limited. On the second phase (1993-2000) the former flag carriers developed their hub-and-spoke systems. The third phase (2001-2015) saw the rise of low-cost market share. This grow was made by opening secondary routes with low fares that generated demand from extended catchment areas. During this phase, the European airline industry  has consolidated (augmented concentration), although competence has increased at the route level. Authors predict the apparition of a fourth phase, in which direct competition between low-cost and full-service carriers will rise as the former begin operating at primary hubs. Two new business models are arising: long-haul, low-cost operators that use the possibilities of the B787 aircraft and lower-cost hub airlines of Turkey and the Gulf region.}",

This act allowed airlines to make all decisions regarding entry, exit and fares, while mergers and acquisitions have to be authorised by regulators. Previously, the sector was regulated by the Civil Aeronautics Board. The positive results of deregulation are lowering of average fares, providing more flights and increasing airline efficiency, while maintaining a good safety record. But fares and services for smaller cities, shorter-haul routes and more concentrated markets have been negatively affected. The worse consequences are the poor results of airlines and the bad working conditions for airline employees. Airline results depend heavily of economic cycle, and the oligopolistic nature of the market lead companies to strategic interdependence, resulting in waves of new entries and concentration.}",

@article{Alderighi2012,
abstract = {This paper investigates the price-setting behavior of full-service airlines in the European passenger aviation market. We develop a model of airline competition, which accommodates various market structures, some of which include low-cost players. Using data on published airfares of Lufthansa, British Airways, Alitalia and KLM for the main city-pairs from Italy to the rest of Europe, our empirical findings substantially confirm the propositions of the theoretical model. We find that competition among full-service carriers appears to affect the price levels of the business and the leisure segments asymmetrically: there are small reductions in the leisure segments and significant reductions in the business segment of the aviation market. In contrast, competition with low-cost carriers reduces both the business and leisure fares of full-service carriers quite uniformly, with an emphasis on the mid-segment fares. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The properties of the Gini index and other measures are compared and dis- cussed in detail in the context of analyzing air trafic distributions.

The Gini index resulted the most adequate measure, followed by Thiel relative entropy and Herfindahl-Hirschmann index. The article makes interesting generic considerations about the properties of different indexes of concentration. Evaluation of Gini index showed that concentration in large hubs increased over time, especially after the enactment of ADA, together with an increase of carriers serving these large hubs. The Gini index for medium hubs was smaller than for large hubs, and the number of carriers serving small hubs increased in the deregulating period, as airlines created feeder routes for the large hubs.}",
