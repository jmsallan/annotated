The case was about the practices of Paolo Macchiarini when developing a technique of artificial trachea transplant, which lead to the death of several patients. Authors research what factors lead to maintaining the misconduct a long time period, what actors lead to the exposure of the misconduct and the lessons learned for other insitutional settings. The case reveals a resource asymmetry between the market-oriented logic and medical and scientific logics. The market-oriented logic fosters academic institutions to focus their efforts to develop their brands and compete for resources.It also reveals the problem of fragmented control in the academic field. Following this market-research logic, the function of scientific quality control is judged as less relevant, and it is outsourced to editors of academic journals. This leads to a fragmented control of scientific activity. Conversely, academic journals are also driven by a market-oriented logic, which may lead them to relax standards of peer reviewing, and an asymmetry between rapid entry (acceptance) and slow exit (retraction). It is significant that the most effective whistleblower of this case was a docummentary on a Swedish television. }"
