First, authors study the evolution of network metrics (scale-free properties, dissortative mixing and small-world properties), and compare them with other major regional blocs. Second, they unveil the core-bridge-periphery structure of the SANN, and its temporal evolution. This multilayer structure has experienced significant changes in the studied period, as the core of the network shifts towards the north. Additionnally, the introduction contains an geographical and historical analysis of Southeast Asia, and discuss the opportunity of defining region boundarys to analyze transportation networks.}",

annote = "{This paper analyzes the vulnerability of a two interdependent networked systems to cascading failures: a power grid and a gas network. The cascading failure model of the power grid is the defined in Wang et al. (2008), where edge load is proportional to the power of product of edge’s nodes. The model for the gas network is the generalized betweenness centrality model defined in Carvalho et al. (2009). Network interdependence is modeled through a specific interdependence function. Nodes that lead to interdependence are detected using spatial proximity criteria. Authors define three categories of network disturbance: random failures, deliberate attacks and natural disasters. Deliberate attacks are defined as suppression of edges of high load and nodes of high degree. The results of the vulnerability metrics are global vulnerability analysis and critical component analysis. Global vulnerability is measured with network efficiency and damaging rate. Critical component analysis reports the network components whose damage would lead to larger vulnerability.}",
