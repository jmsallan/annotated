The model for the gas network is the generalized betweenness centrality model defined in Carvalho et al. (2009). Network interdependence is modeled through a specific interdependence function. Nodes that lead to interdependence are detected using spatial proximity criteria. Authors define three categories of network disturbance: random failures, deliberate attacks and natural disasters. Deliberate attacks are defined as suppression of edges of high load and nodes of high degree. The results of the vulnerability metrics are global vulnerability analysis and critical component analysis. Global vulnerability is measured with network efficiency and damaging rate. Critical component analysis reports the network components whose damage would lead to larger vulnerability.}",

Our approach, based on percolation theory, leads to a general condition for the critical fraction of nodes, p(c), that needs to be removed before the network disintegrates.

The goal of this work is to determine network design guidelines which maximize the robustness of networks to both random failure and intentional attack while keeping the cost of the network (which we take to be the average number of links per node) constant. We find optimal parameters for: (i) scale free networks having degree distributions with a single power-law regime, (ii) networks having degree distributions with two power-law regimes, and (iii) networks described by degree distributions containing two peaks. Of these various kinds of distributions we find that the optimal network design is one in which all but one of the nodes have the same degree, {\$}k{\_}1{\$} (close to the average number of links per node), and one node is of very large degree, {\$}k{\_}2 \backslashsim N{\^{}}{\{}2/3{\}}{\$}, where {\$}N{\$} is the number of nodes in the network.},

abstract = {Many complex systems display a surprising degree of tolerance against errors. For example, relatively simple organisms grow, persist and reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or environmental interventions, an error tolerance attributed to the robustness of the underlying metabolic network. Complex communication networks display a surprising degree of robustness: although key components regularly malfunction, local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. The stability of these and other complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. Here we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems: it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free networks, which include the World-Wide Web, the Internet, social networks and cells. We find that such networks display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected even by unrealistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks (that is, to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play a vital role in maintaining the network's connectivity). Such error tolerance and attack vulnerability are generic properties of communication networks.},

abstract = {Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators, Josephson junction arrays, excitable media, neural networks, spatial games, genetic control networks and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability.

abstract = {This paper studies an interesting graph measure that we call the effective graph resistance. The notion of effective graph resistance is derived from the field of electric circuit analysis where it is defined as the accumulated effective resistance between all pairs of vertices. The objective of the paper is twofold. First, we survey known formulae of the effective graph resistance and derive other representations as well. The derivation of new expressions is based on the analysis of the associated random walk on the graph and applies tools from Markov chain theory. This approach results in a new method to approximate the effective graph resistance. A second objective of this paper concerns the optimisation of the effective graph resistance for graphs with given number of vertices and diameter, and for optimal edge addition. A set of analytical results is described, as well as results obtained by exhaustive search. One of the foremost applications of the effective graph resistance we have in mind, is the analysis of robustness-related problems. However, with our discussion of this informative graph measure we hope to open up a wealth of possibilities of applying the effective graph resistance to all kinds of networks problems. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The deregulation of the US domestic airline industry resulted in the reconfiguration of airline networks into hub-and-spoke systems. In contrast to the US airlines, airlines in Europe already operated spatially concentrated networks long before deregulation. This concentration at the national home-base was the outcome of bilateral traffic rights designated to the national carrier. With a few exemptions, however, most of these star-shaped networks were not coordinated in time. Transfer opportunities at most national airports only existed by accident. Only airports that were operated as gateways to Europe provided planned connectivity between intercontinental flights and European feeder services. The deregulation of the EU market stimulated a second phase of airline network restructuring. European airlines concentrated their networks by adopting or intensifying wave-system structures ('banks' to use the US term) in their flight schedules. This paper investigates these post-deregulation temporal concentrations in European aviation networks. The development and configuration of wave-system structures at European airline hubs is analyzed as well as the resulting transfer opportunities during the 1990s. It is found that a temporal concentration trend exists among European airlines with deregulation resulting in the adoption or intensification of wave-system structures by airlines. These wave-system structures, as well as overall traffic growth, have significantly stimulated the number of indirect hub connections. Airline hubs with wave-system structures generally perform better because of the increased indirect connectivity given the number of direct connections. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Terrorist attacks on transportation networks have traumatized modern societies. With a single blast, it has become possible to paralyze airline traffic, electric power supply, ground transportation or Internet communication. How and at which cost can one restructure the network such that it will become more robust against a malicious attack? We introduce a unique measure for robustness and use it to devise a method to mitigate economically and efficiently this risk. We demonstrate its efficiency on the European electricity system and on the Internet as well as on complex networks models. We show that with small changes in the network structure (low cost) the robustness of diverse networks can be improved dramatically while their functionality remains unchanged. Our results are useful not only for improving significantly with low cost the robustness of existing infrastructures but also for designing economically robust network systems.},

@article{Louzada2013,
	abstract = {In the study of networks, it is often insightful to use algorithms to determine mesoscale features such as "community structure", in which densely connected sets of nodes constitute "communities" that have sparse connections to other communities. The most popular way of detecting communities algorithmically is to optimize the quality function known as modularity. When optimizing modularity, one compares the actual connections in a (static or time-dependent) network to the connections obtained from a random-graph ensemble that acts as a null model. The communities are then the sets of nodes that are connected to each other densely relative to what is expected from the null model. Clearly, the process of community detection depends fundamentally on the choice of null model, so it is important to develop and analyze novel null models that take into account appropriate features of the system under study. In this paper, we investigate the effects of using null models that take incorporate spatial information, and we propose a novel null model based on the radiation model of population spread. We also develop novel synthetic spatial benchmark networks in which the connections between entities are based on distance or flux between nodes, and we compare the performance of both static and time-dependent radiation null models to the standard ("Newman-Girvan") null model for modularity optimization and a recently-proposed gravity null model. In our comparisons, we use both the above synthetic benchmarks and time-dependent correlation networks that we construct using countrywide dengue fever incidence data for Peru. We also evaluate a recently-proposed correlation null model, which was developed specifically for correlation networks that are constructed from time series, on the epidemic-correlation data.},

@article{Yang2015,
	abstract = {Complex networks are everywhere, such as the power grid network, the airline network, the protein-protein interaction network, and the road network. The networks are 'robust yet fragile', which means that the networks are robust against random failures but fragile under malicious attacks. The cascading failures, system-wide disasters and intentional attacks on these networks are deserving of in-depth study. Researchers have proposed many solutions to improve the robustness of these networks. However whilst many solutions preserve the degree distribution of the networks, little attention is paid to the community structure of these networks. We argue that the community structure of a network is a defining characteristic of a network which identifies its functionality and thus should be preserved. In this paper, we discuss the relationship between robustness and the community structure. Then we propose a 3-step strategy to improve the robustness of a network, while retaining its community structure, and also its degree distribution. With extensive experimentation on representative real-world networks, we demonstrate that our method is effective and can greatly improve the robustness of networks, while preserving community structure and degree distribution. Finally, we give a description of a robust network, which is useful not only for improving robustness, but also for designing robust networks and integrating networks.},

Several existing complex network models as well as real-world networks of scientific collaborations and Internet traffic are numerically investigated, and the network performance is quantitatively measured by the average inverse geodesic length and the size of the largest connected subgraph. For each case of attacks on vertices and edges, four different attacking strategies are used: removals by the descending order of the degree and the betweenness centrality, calculated for either the initial network or the current network during the removal procedure. It is found that the removals by the recalculated degrees and betweenness centralities are often more harmful than the attack strategies based on the initial network, suggesting that the network structure changes as important vertices or edges are removed.

These highly interconnected systems have recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e., either present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the network. We define appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to investigate the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network. These results provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.},

As a special example of the latter we consider mixing according to vertex degree, i.e., according to the number of connections vertices have to other vertices: do gregarious people tend to associate with other gregarious people? We propose a number of measures of assortative mixing appropriate to the various mixing types, and apply them to a variety of real-world networks, showing that assortative mixing is a pervasive phenomenon found in many networks. We also propose several models of assortatively mixed networks, both analytic ones based on generating function methods, and numerical ones based on Monte Carlo graph generation techniques. We use these models to probe the properties of networks as their level of assortativity is varied. In the particular case of mixing by degree, we find strong variation with assortativity in the connectivity of the network and in the resilience of the network to the removal of vertices.},

Both structural and simple dynamical properties are considered, for eight major air networks and different source datasets. Results indicate that using a subset of airports strongly distorts our perception of the network, even when just small ones are discarded; at the same time, considering a subset of airlines yields a better and more stable representation.

Resilience analysis of the Airports Network can offer an insight into airport network readiness and response behaviour to any catastrophic event. A complex network analysis approach of such a network can offer an insight about its structure, performance and resilience under various levels of perturbation. In this paper, we present a complex network approach for measuring the performance and estimating the resilience of an airport network using the Australian Airports Network (AAN) as a case study. Real air traffic data for all domestic flights in the Australian airspace for the year 2011 is used to form the network. Resilience is then assessed under different failure scenarios. The complex network analysis reveals that the AAN can be classified as a scale- free small-world network and that its structure is resilient to random failures of airports (e.g., shutdowns) and random disruptions of flight paths (e.g., airways unavailable due to bad weather). It also indicates that the AAN remains connected and incurs minimal increase in travel times and reduced ‘reachability' when a majority of its nodes (airports) are removed or its edges (airways) become randomly unavailable. In the case of a targeted failure (a targeted isolated airport shutdown), the AAN is more sensitive to node failure by a descending order of degree as well as ‘betweenness centrality'.},

	abstract = {In this research, we propose a new methodology to assess structural similarity of air navigation route systems in 58 countries. We identify functional dependencies among network metrics through regression analysis. We build a graph for the network metrics, with each metric as a node and a link existing if there is a functional dependency between two metrics. We find that the air navigation route systems in France and Italy are most similar. The air navigation route systems in Oceania ensemble common features of most countries and should be used as representatives for analysis of new air traffic management operational procedures.},
	annote = {The paper reports a structural similarity analysis of the air route networks of the 58 countries with largest air route networks. In air navigation route networks, nodes are air navigation points and links are route segments connecting air navigation points. Data is obtained from the European Aeronautical Information Service Database, EAD) provided by Eurocontrol. Contains a useful review on air route networks analysis and network comparison. The methodology used to compare air route networks needs to be refined. For instance, authors first discard Pearson correlation coefficients because variables are not normally distributed. Then, use $R^2$ of pairs of regression analysis as a measure of association. Other techniques used are clustering analysis and principal component analysis.},

	annote = {This article analyzes an air route network, a spatial network where nodes are air route waypoints (ARW) and the edges air route segments (ARS), with weight equal to the number of flights passing on a time window. Nodes in this network cannot have hubs, which would lead to traffic congestion and flight conflicts. As a consequence, the air route network has an homogeneous degree distribution, together with an heterogeneous, exponential strength distribution. Instant values and evolution of node strength can be useful elements to assess the evolution of air traffic in a geographical region.},
