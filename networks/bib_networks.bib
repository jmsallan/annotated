Second, they unveil the core-bridge-periphery structure of the SANN, and its temporal evolution. This multilayer structure has experienced significant changes in the studied period, as the core of the network shifts towards the north. Additionnally, the introduction contains an geographical and historical analysis of Southeast Asia, and discuss the opportunity of defining region boundarys to analyze transportation networks.}",

The cascading failure model of the power grid is the defined in Wang et al. (2008), where edge load is proportional to the power of product of edge’s nodes. The model for the gas network is the generalized betweenness centrality model defined in Carvalho et al. (2009). Network interdependence is modeled through a specific interdependence function. Nodes that lead to interdependence are detected using spatial proximity criteria. Authors define three categories of network disturbance: random failures, deliberate attacks and natural disasters. Deliberate attacks are defined as suppression of edges of high load and nodes of high degree. The results of the vulnerability metrics are global vulnerability analysis and critical component analysis. Global vulnerability is measured with network efficiency and damaging rate. Critical component analysis reports the network components whose damage would lead to larger vulnerability.}",

In these networks, the load of a node is equal to the total number of shortest paths passing through it (sometimes approximated by node betweenness). The capacity of a node is proportional to its initial load. The failure of a node can lead to a redistribution of loads, that can conversely lead to the failure of nodes in which capacity is exceeded. Authors find that cascading failures occur in networks with a highly heterogeneous distribution of loads (e.g., scale-free networks), when the removed nodes are among those of higher load.}",

The instantaneous network at any point of time includes all pairs of individuals that sent one of more messages in each direction in the last 60 days. Using the later representation, they calculate the shortest path length and the number of shared affiliations for all members during 210 days. Appearance of new ties is assessed with two measures. Cyclic closure bias is the empirical probability that two individuals initiate a new tie as a function of shortest path length. Focal closure bias is the probability that two individuals who share an interaction focus share a new tie. For this network, average network properties appear to approach an equilibrium state, while individual properties are unstable.}",

abstract = {A common property of many large networks, including the Internet, is that the connectivity of the various nodes follows a scale-free power-law distribution, P(k) = ck(-alpha). We study the stability of such networks with respect to crashes, such as random removal of sites. Our approach, based on percolation theory, leads to a general condition for the critical fraction of nodes, p(c), that needs to be removed before the network disintegrates. We show analytically and numerically that for alpha{\textless}/=3 the transition never takes place, unless the network is finite. In the special case of the physical structure of the Internet (alpha approximately 2.5), we find that it is impressively robust, with p(c){\textgreater}0.99.},

abstract = {Networks with a given degree distribution may be very resilient to one type of failure or attack but not to another. The goal of this work is to determine network design guidelines which maximize the robustness of networks to both random failure and intentional attack while keeping the cost of the network (which we take to be the average number of links per node) constant. We find optimal parameters for: (i) scale free networks having degree distributions with a single power-law regime, (ii) networks having degree distributions with two power-law regimes, and (iii) networks described by degree distributions containing two peaks. Of these various kinds of distributions we find that the optimal network design is one in which all but one of the nodes have the same degree, {\$}k{\_}1{\$} (close to the average number of links per node), and one node is of very large degree, {\$}k{\_}2 \backslashsim N{\^{}}{\{}2/3{\}}{\$}, where {\$}N{\$} is the number of nodes in the network.},

@article{Albert2000,
abstract = {Many complex systems display a surprising degree of tolerance against errors. For example, relatively simple organisms grow, persist and reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or environmental interventions, an error tolerance attributed to the robustness of the underlying metabolic network. Complex communication networks display a surprising degree of robustness: although key components regularly malfunction, local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. The stability of these and other complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. Here we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems: it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free networks, which include the World-Wide Web, the Internet, social networks and cells. We find that such networks display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected even by unrealistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks (that is, to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play a vital role in maintaining the network's connectivity). Such error tolerance and attack vulnerability are generic properties of communication networks.},

Over the past 10 years there have been numerous examples where a local disturbance has lead to the global failure of systems.

We then analyze these networks for topological regularities that explain the source of such resilience. The analysis reveals that clustering, modularity and long path lengths all play an important part in the design of robust large-scale infrastructure. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.
