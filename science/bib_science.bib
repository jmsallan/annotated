	annote = "{The paper analyzes a case of medical and academic misconduct, the Karolinska case, using a institutional theory framework. The case was about the practices of Paolo Macchiarini when developing a technique of artificial trachea transplant, which lead to the death of several patients. Authors research what factors lead to maintaining the misconduct a long time period, what actors lead to the exposure of the misconduct and the lessons learned for other insitutional settings. The case reveals a resource asymmetry between the market-oriented logic and medical and scientific logics. The market-oriented logic fosters academic institutions to focus their efforts to develop their brands and compete for resources.It also reveals the problem of fragmented control in the academic field. Following this market-research logic, the function of scientific quality control is judged as less relevant, and it is outsourced to editors of academic journals. This leads to a fragmented control of scientific activity. Conversely, academic journals are also driven by a market-oriented logic, which may lead them to relax standards of peer reviewing, and an asymmetry between rapid entry (acceptance) and slow exit (retraction). It is significant that the most effective whistleblower of this case was a docummentary on a Swedish television. }",

The cultural problems of science are: A workforce imbalance favouring male, senior researchers; favouring strong competition for funding and positions; and operating under the priority rule, where credit goes to the one that provides answer first. This culture leads to saturation of the peer review system, publication bias, taking conservative approaches to acquire funding and creating incentives for scientific misconduct. This culture drives the increase of honest and dishonest retractions, eroding the credibility of science. As methodological reforms, authors propose revision of criteria of promotion, re-embracing philosophy (logic, epistemology and ethics) in scientific training, enhanced training in probability and statistics, and use of checklist in publication workflow. As cultural reforms, they propose replacing competition by collaboration.}",

annote = "{Authors assess critically the present state of science and advocate for its reform. This manuscript focus on structural reforms, focusing on biomedical science in the United States. Many dysfunctional aspects of science are rational responses to scientist to incentives presented by the present system. These incentives are driven mainly by how governmental financial support is provided to scientists. Authors identify five structural problems. Inadequate funding is leading to a hypercompetitive scientific environment, and indirect costs are underestimated. Agencies reduce funding to investigator-initiated projects, favouring targeted research and big science, while the success of targeted research depends on previous funding on basic science. Many women and minorities achieve success in scientific career, leading to leaky pipelines in the scientific system. There is an increase of administrative burden to address concerns on animal welfare, patient safety and the accountability of public funds. The grant peer review system is not effective in ranking grant applications. In addition to obvious remedies, authors propose balancing and renewing the scuentific workforce, recognize the impact of basic research, restrict laboratory size, and undertake a scientific study of science.}",

It is particularly useful when there is uncertainty on how respondents will answer questionnaires or doubt about their understanding of the wording of questions. Response problems can be: lexical, inclusion/exclusion (scope of the question), temporal, logical (questions with connecting words requiring more than one answer) and computational. Cognitive interview techniques are: probing (require informants to paraphrase questions in their own words), observing respondentâ€™s behaviour, and to encourage respondents to verbalize their thoughts (think aloud) about the questionnaire. Problems found while answering the questionnaire can be classified in four headings: understanding, retrieval, judgement and response formatting.
